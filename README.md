# Dark detector with LDR and LCD GM12864-59N
--------------------------------------------
Ambient light sensor with an LDR type resistor, configuring a voltage divider circuit.
The ambient light intensity is displayed on a 128x64 LCD screen (I2C interface), indicating three states: light, semi-darkness and darness. In the "darkness" range, an LED connected to the digital pin D12 of an Arduino Nano clone lights up.
